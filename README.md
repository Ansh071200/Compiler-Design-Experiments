# Compiler-Design-Experiments

This repository is a comprehensive guide to compiler design, featuring Flex &amp; Bison files for lexical analysis and parsing, Java, C++, and C programs for various compiler stages, and MIPS assembly codes for code generation. Essential setup instructions and download links are provided for seamless exploration.

**Compiler Design Experiments Repository üñ•Ô∏è**

Welcome to the Compiler Design Experiments repository! This collection encompasses a range of programs and scripts crucial for understanding and implementing various aspects of compiler design. Below is a breakdown of the contents and how to navigate through them:

### Contents:

1. **Flex Program Files (.l):** {Exp 2 & 3}
   - These files contain lexical analyzer specifications written in Flex.
   - They are crucial for tokenizing input streams in the compiler pipeline.
2. **Bison Files (.y and .tab):** {Exp 4}

   - Bison files (.y) contain grammar specifications in BNF notation.
   - Corresponding .tab files are generated by Bison and include parser implementations.
   - These are fundamental for parsing input according to the defined grammar.

3. **Java Programs:** {Exp 7 & 8}

   - Java implementations relevant to compiler design.
   - These may include symbol table management, intermediate code generation, etc.

4. **C++ Programs:** {Exp 1,5 & 9}

   - C++ implementations often used for backend tasks like optimization and code generation.

5. **C Programs:** {Exp 6}

   - C programs related to various stages of compiler construction.

6. **MIPS Assembly Language Codes (.text files):** {Exp 11,12}

   - Assembly language code executable on MIPS architecture.
   - Useful for understanding code generation and backend optimization

7. **Study Expermint** {Exp 10}
   - Introduction to the MIPS architecture.

### Setup Instructions:

- Each folder contains files specific to a particular aspect of compiler design.
- Ensure you have the necessary compilers and interpreters installed to run the programs.
- For Flex and Bison files, you'll need Flex and Bison installed.
- For Java programs, a Java Development Kit (JDK) is required.
- For C/C++ programs, a compatible compiler like GCC or Clang is needed.
- MIPS assembly language files can be simulated using a MIPS simulator.

### Getting Started:

1. **Download Flex:** [Flex](https://www.gnu.org/software/flex/) üí™
2. **Download Bison:** [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) üêÉ
3. **Download JDK:** [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) ‚òï
4. **Download GCC:** [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) üõ†Ô∏è
5. **MIPS Simulator:** [MARS45 Download](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Coding-languages-Compilers/Vollmar-MARS.shtml) üöÄ

### Running Instructions:

**C Programs:**

- Compile using: `gcc filename`

**Flex Programs:**

- Generate lex.yy.c: `flex filename`
- Compile lex.yy.c: `gcc lex.yy.c`

**Bison Programs:**

- Generate lex.yy.c: `win_flex filename`
- Generate parser.tab.c and parser.tab.h: `win_bison -d filename`

**Java Programs:**

- Use VS Code with Java installed

**MIPS Assembly Codes:**

- Utilize MARS45 for assembly and execution

Ensure to follow these instructions for running the respective programs successfully. Detailed setup instructions are provided above. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª
